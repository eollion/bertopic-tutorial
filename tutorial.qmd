# Introduction 

What are the main issues adressed in a set of documents ? Are those documents similar or discussing different issues POUET ? What is the most important topic ? Delineating the main topics in a set of documents is a common task in social sciences; especially when working with a new corpus. Of course, identifying the topics can be done by hand. But when dealing with large corpora, this task is almost impossible without some kind of automation; hence, for quite some time now, social scientists have used **topic modelling** techniques to quickly extract the main themes in their corpus (Asmussen & Møller, 2019), either to explore them or to attribute a label to each document to conduct further analysis.

> **Topic modelling** is a natural language processing task that extracts latent topics structuring a corpora.<br/>
> _For instance, Jockers & Mimno (2013) extracted broad themes in the English literature from the 19th century._ 
>
> **Natural language processing (NLP)** is a subfield of computer science that analyses textual data. Main NLP tasks are text generation (like chatGPT), text classification, or topic modelling.

![Topic Modelling in-out sketch](assets/topic_modelling_scheme.png){#fig-schema}

Until recently, topic modelling techniques — and natural language processing (NLP) in general — heavily relied on word counts, especially bag-of-words approaches. Amongst other limits, those approaches do not take into account the context in which a word is used — the order of the words in a sentence does not matter to those models, thus failing to grasp the complexity of the human language.

To tackle this limit, researchers developed transformations that generate richer and denser representations based on deep learning models. Those models take the text as an entry and generate a vector representation called **embeddings**. BERTopic is a topic model package written in Python language that leverages embeddings generated by pre-trained transformer models[^14] to delineate coherent topics based on the semantic similarity of texts. 

Since its inception in 2022, BERTopic has already proven to be useful in various studies. _For instance, Bizel-Bizellot et al. (2024) used it to analyze survey-free-text answers and identify the main circumstances of infection with COVID-19. In a different field, Törnberg & Törnberg (2025) analysed images and texts to highlight trends regarding misinformation on climate.

BERTopic is a brilliant tool that unlocks diverse paths but may require some time to master. In this tutorial, we focus on the general philosophy and how to use BERTopic in a social science project. We will demonstrate how to start with a text corpus and create a topic model that makes sense. We will create a topic model of the PhD theses defended between 2010 and 2022 in France to describe what keeps French PhD students busy!

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

- Get an idea of what you can do with topic modelling in social science
- Set up a topic model on your data and make sense of the results
- Understand each step of the BERTopic pipeline and customise it

We conclude this tutorial with a discussion about the evaluation of topic modelling and good practices for reproducibility.  <!-- I think we need to stay at the discussion level -->

**Python, Machine Learning and NLP prerequisites**

We don't assume that you have any knowledge about NLP and try our best to explain every step in an agnostic manner. We also provide numerous references if you want to dig deeper.

Nevertheless, you need to have some notions of Python. If you need to refresh your Python skills, you can use [Lino Galina's courses](https://pythonds.linogaliana.fr/en/). We assume that:

- you have a working environment and can install packages
- you know the basic syntax of Python (functions, variables, if-statements, for loops) and you're comfortable enough with Pandas to load your documents and proceed to simple manipulations such as creating, dropping and renaming columns and rows.

In this tutorial, we use python 3.12, and you can install the packages we will need with :

```python
pip install -U bertopic pandas scikit-learn datasets plotly kaleido stopwordsiso nbformat ipykernel
```

We provide a detailed requirement file that should work for Linux and MacOS.

# Understanding BERTopic

## The BERTopic pipeline

The BERTopic pipeline takes a list of text documents and returns meaningful topics as well as a mapping from the text documents to the said topics. The goal is to be able to gather documents that are semantically close in clusters and then describe these topics for further interpretation. Once you have a set of topics, you can come back to the corpus to describe its composition. 

Here is a basic usage of BERTopic which uses the main methods :

```python
from bertopic import BERTopic

# Load your documents
documents = [
	"My cat is the cutest.",
	"Offer your cat premium food.",
	"The Empire State Building is 1,250 feet tall",
]

# Create a BERTopic object
topic_model = BERTopic()

# Fit your model to your documents
topic_model.fit(documents)

# Predict the topics and probabilities
topic, probabilities = topic_model.transform(documents)

# Or do it all at once
topic, probabilities = topic_model.fit_transform(documents)
```

:::{.callout-note}

The methods  `fit`, `transform`, and `fit_transform` belong to a common syntax in machine learning systematized by Scikit-learn, one of the first and most complete machine learning library in Python. A vanilla model is fitted on the data (parameters are tweaked), and then the model is used to make predictions on new data.

:::

The transformation produces two outputs.

- The `topic` variable is a list containing integers: for each document, the integer represents the topic/group it belongs to. In our case, `topic = [0, 0, 1]` as the first 2 documents mention cats, whereas the last document is about the Empire State Building.
- The `probabilities` variable is a list of floats: for each document, the float represents how close it is to the topic.

We can then retrieve topic information that will return keywords that best represent our corpus:

```python
topic_info = topic_model.get_topic_info()
```

The `topic_info` variable is a table like this :

| Topic | Count | Name       | Representation | Representative_Docs                            |
| ----- | ----- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | 2     | 0_cat      | "cat"          | "My cat is the cutest"                         |
| 1     | 1     | 1_building | "building"     | "The Empire State Building is 1,250 feet tall" |

: Topic information for a simplified corpus {#tbl-topics-example tbl-colwidths="[10, 10, 20, 20,40]"}

The `Topic` column lists the topic IDs, the `Count` column lists the number of element there are in each topic, the `Name` column is a summary of topic ID and keywords — listed in the `Representation` column, and finally the `Representative_Docs` lists example of documents that are representative of the topic.


In reality, this example would not run because there are not enough documents! Let's have a look at what one can expect from BERTopic, working with a real dataset: the abstracts of all the theses defended in France since 2010. After carefully setting the parameters and verifying the topic model's quality, we obtain the following results:


|   Topic |   Count | Name                                 | Representation                                                                     |

## Breaking down the process

Under the hood, BERTopic does three main steps :

- Generate a mathematical representation of each document that captures the semantic properties — **the embeddings**.
- Based on the embeddings, identify groups of documents that are semantically close (this action is called **clustering**). The hope is that these groups represent latent topics of the corpus.
- For each identified topic/group, retrieve keywords that best describe the specificity of each topic.

### How to generate the embeddings?

To generate the embeddings we use **encoder models**. Encoder models are a type of pre-trained transformer models[^19] whose job is to encapsulate the semantic of textual data. A good example of encoder is the BERT model and all it's successors like RoBERTa or DeBERTa. By default, BERTopic uses a packaged called sentence-bert, or **SBERT**, for generating embeddings. 
<br/>
Encoder models can take in a limitted number of tokens (parts of words), this is called the **context window size**. For smaller models, the context window size is of about 500 tokens (200 words on average) like for BERT and larger models like ModernBERT have a context window size of 8,000 tokens.

:::

The embeddings — *ie* the generated vectors, contain hundreds of dimensions (for instance, the dimension of BERT's embeddings is 512). Clustering algorithms work poorly with this many dimensions so we need to reduce the dimensionality of the embedding space (typically between 2 and 10). To reduce the dimensionality, the BERTopic pipeline uses the **UMAP** algorithm for it's ability to grasp local and global structures (McInnes et al., 2018)[^1]. This mean that, despite moving from several hundreds of dimensions to only a couple, documents that are close together will stay close and distant ones will stay further apart. This is a critical step as we are heavily changing the structure of the data.

### How to generate clusters

The goal for the clustering algorithm is to create groups of documents that are semantically close. We are not certain that the output clusters will be "real" topics, but we tune the BERTopic pipeline in order for the clusters to be representatives of topics that are latent in our corpus.

Different algorithms can be used for clustering. **HDBSCAN** was chosen for it's ability to detect clusters based on their density, hence it is able to detect clusters of various shapes and density. HDBSCAN also allows for documents to be labeled as noise to primarily focus on dense and coherent groups.

### How to describe topics / retrieve keywords

Once we have created groups of documents, we need to create a meaningful representation of these topics. The general idea in BERTopic is to identify keywords that best describe the specificity of each topic.

To achieve that, it needs to come back to all the texts in the cluster and discompose them at the word level[^16]. It uses word-count-based techniques that will count the number of occurrences of each word[^5]. There are different strategies to make this word-count-based representation better. For instance, we can choose to remove stop-words — words that do not carry much semantic information (ex: "the", "I", "is", "but", ... ). Other solutions include lemmatisation of words to consider “cats" and "cat" as one word.

The idea is to create a word x document matrix. The most basic strategy is to use `CountVectorizer` object from `scikit-learn` that will create a word x document matrix.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Example"}

Given the two following documents:

 - "My cat is the cutest.",
 - "Offer your cat premium food.",

The word x document matrix would be:

|         | doc 1 | doc 2 |
| ------- | ----- | ----- |
| cat     | 1     | 1     |
| cutest  | 1     | 0     |
| offer   | 0     | 1     |
| premium | 0     | 1     |
| food    | 0     | 1     |

:::

The `word x document` matrix is never used as is and needs transformation to outline relevant words. The usual transformation is called TF-IDF. This transformation raises the score of words that appear often in a document and decreases the score of words that appear in many documents.
In BERTopic, they use an alternative called **c-TF-IDF**. This transformation raises the score of words that appear often in documents of the same group and decreases the score of words appearing in other groups. With this transformation, we retrieve words that make a group unique!

:::

## Conclusion

To sum it up we have:

- First, generate embeddings that encapsulate semantic information with **SBERT** and reduce the dimensionality of vectors to a manageable number of dimensions with **UMAP**.
- Then create groups of semantically close documents with **HDBSCAN**. Each group can represent latent topics in our corpus.
- Create meaningful representations of each topic by counting words in the documents with **CountVectorizer** and outline the most representative words with **c-TF-IDF**.

# Hands on with Python

Now we understand broadly the BERTopic pipeline, let's see how to apply it to our dataset.

## Preprocessing your data

As mentioned before, we will use the dataset listing all theses defended in France since 1985. The original dataset can be downloaded on [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/datasets/theses-soutenues-en-france-depuis-1985/). To avoid excessive pre-processing, we curated[^17] the dataset and uploaded it (with the code) on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17416954).

It is crucial to stress that the preprocessing step is **the most important step**. Although we can tune the topic model towards meaningful clusters and representations, your corpus is your input and no model will generate good results out of poor inputs. We list a number of questions you need to consider and justify for your topic model to be relevant:

**Is my corpus homogenous enough ?**

It could be tempting to shove millions of different documents from different sources in a topic model and see what comes out. However, to make sure that the groups will represent topics, one must be sure that your documents are similar in formality, tone, length, density of information etc... If your corpus is too heterogenous, the topic model can highlight theses differences and you will lose sight of meaningful latent topics[^6].

In our case, as we analyse theses abstracts which are quite standardised, the corpus should be homogenous enough for the topic model to pick up topics and not other semantic dimensions.

**Are my documents in the right language?**

Most of the time, language models are trained in a single language. Some models are said multi-lingual and accept texts in more than one language. However, in our experience, working with documents in different languages generates poor topics as the language shift holds for the most salient difference and each language is clustered by itself. We recommend translating your documents in a single language beforehand.

In our case, the data curation allowed us to extract theses where both the english and french abstracts were provided and we will work with abstracts in each language separately.

**How long are my documents?**

One need to precisely define their task before diving into topic modelling. What are you trying to analyse? Will this information be available at the sentence level? paragraph level? the document level?

In our case, the topic of the theses will be described throughout the abstract, hence the abstract must be taken as a whole and not subdivided at the sentence level.

Also, as introduced before, each embedding model has a context window, meaning that long documents will be truncated. One must make sure that the length of the documents in their corpus is smaller than the model's context window. If the context window is too small consider changing embedding model. Careful though, larger context window means longer computation time and greater computation resources required to run the model.

We will confirm the length of our documents before calling the embedding model.

## Let's code!

Let's load the dataset:

<!-- NOTE Where to import ? when necessary or at the beginning? -->

```python
df_raw = pd.read_csv("./data/theses-soutenues-curated.csv")
```

The dataset contains the following columns :

- `CI`: Custom index, values are `CI-XXXX`, with `XXXX` ranging from 0 to 164,378
- `year`: the year of the defence, values are integers ranging from 2010 to 2022
- `oai_set_specs`: the oai code, each code looks like `ddc:XXX`, for instance `ddc:300` refers to `Sciences sociales, sociologie, anthropologie`.
- `resumes.en` and `resumes.fr`: the abstract of the phd dissertation, respectively in english and french. We are sure that every row contains a valid abstract in the right language thanks to the data curation.
- `titres.en` and `titres.fr`: the titles of the PhD dissertation, respectively in english and french. Only 5% of the rows do not have a valid title (french or english). The language of the titles has not been checked because it will only be used to check the qualitative validity of topic model. [Refer to the notebook to see the code.](google.com)
- `topics.en` and `topics.fr`: the aggregated topics provided by the author. Only 5% of the rows do not have valid topics (french or english). The language of the topics has not been checked because they will only be used to check the qualitative validity of topic model.

Let's take some time to check if our documents fit inside the context window.
To retrieve the context window size, you can check the HuggingFace page of the model or load the configuration file that contains this information as such:

```python
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code = True)
print(f"Context window size of the model {model_name}: {config.max_position_embeddings}")
```

Let's look at two models, `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (default embedding model in the BERTopic pipeline) and `Alibaba-NLP/gte-multilingual-base`.

```bash
>>> Context window size of the model sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2: 512
>>> Context window size of the model Alibaba-NLP/gte-multilingual-base: 8192
```

And now let's look at the length of our documents:

```python
df_raw["resumes.en.len"] = df_raw["resumes.en"].apply(len)
df_raw["resumes.fr.len"] = df_raw["resumes.fr"].apply(len)
df_raw.loc[:,["resumes.en.len", "resumes.fr.len"]].describe()
```

|      | resumes.en | resumes.fr |
| ---- | ---------- | ---------- |
| min  | 1          | 6          |
| 25%  | 1324       | 1508       |
| 50%  | 1617       | 1702       |
| 75%  | 2080       | 2362       |
| max  | 12010      | 12207      |
| mean | 1777       | 1984       |
| std  | 735        | 802        |

: Descriptive statistics of the length of the abstracts in english and in french {tbl-colwidths="[20,40,40]"}

With these statistics, we see that we can rule out using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` because it's context window is too narrow. By keeping abstracts between 1000 and 4000 characters (ie between 300 and 1300 tokens[^7]) we can keep most of the dataset (89%) while maintaining a reasonable computation time.

```python
valid_index = np.logical_and.reduce([
	df_raw["resumes.fr.len"] >= 1000,
	df_raw["resumes.fr.len"] <= 4000,
	df_raw["resumes.en.len"] >= 1000,
	df_raw["resumes.en.len"] <= 4000,
])

df = df_raw.loc[valid_index,:]
```

Even if it is more interesting to process the complete dataset, it can be computationally expensive. To limit computation time at least for the exploratory steps, we are going to work on a sample of documents. To maintain some representativeness, we stratify this sampling by the year of the defence[^8].

```python
stratification_column = "year"
samples_per_stratum = 500
df_stratified = (
	df
	.groupby(stratification_column, as_index = False)
	.apply(lambda x : x.sample(n = samples_per_stratum), include_groups=True)
	.reset_index()
	.drop(["level_0", "level_1"], axis = 1)
)
# Save the preprocessed dataset
df_stratified.to_csv("./data/theses-soutenues-curated-stratified.csv", index=False)
```

The resulting stratified table contains 6500 rows.

## Create a BERTopic instance, fit and transform {#sec-create-instance}

To create a `topic_model` object we need to create a `BERTopic` object and define some parameters. For now, we will not change the default parameters of the clustering model (`hdbscan_model`) or the dimension reduction model (`umap_model`). We will however define the language of the corpus as well as the vectorizer model in order to remove all stopwords and retrieve meaningful topics. Then, one must use the `fit` method to fit the topic model to the corpus.

<!-- TODO: choose models to display --> 

```python
language = "english" # or "french"
language_short = language[:2] # "en" or "fr"
embedding_model = "answerdotai/ModernBERT-base"
docs = df_stratified[f"resumes.{language_short}"]

vectorizer_model = CountVectorizer(stop_words = list(stopwords(language_short)))

topic_model = BERTopic(
	language = language,
    embedding_model = embedding_model,
	vectorizer_model = vectorizer_model,
)
topic_model.fit(documents=docs)
```

This snippet of code takes a long time to run (>10 mins) as each element must be embedded first. To avoid unnecessary computation time, we have embedded 6500 elements with several models for the French and English abstracts that you can download from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17416954). The code changes as such: 

```python
language = "english" # or "french"
language_short = language[:2] # "en" or "fr"

# Load the embeddings directly to avoid long computation time
ds = load_from_disk(f"./data/embeddings/gte-multilingual-base-{language_short}-SBERT")
docs = np.array(ds[f"resumes.{language_short}"]) # 6500 rows
embeddings = np.array(ds["embedding"])			 # Shape : 6500 x 768

vectorizer_model = CountVectorizer(stop_words = list(stopwords(language_short)))


topic_model = BERTopic(
	language = language,
	vectorizer_model = vectorizer_model,
)
topic_model.fit(documents=docs, embeddings=embeddings)
```

Now to extract the topics, we need to call the `transform` method : 

```python
topics, probabilities = topic_model.transform(documents=docs, embeddings=embeddings)
```

And to explore the topics we can call the `get_topics_info` method that will return a table with the keywords, representative documents and the number of documents in each topic: 

```python 
topic_info = topic_model.get_topic_info()
topic_info
```

|     |   Topic |   Count | Representation                                                                                                          |

: Topic information (truncated) of the french theses for a basic topic model {#tbl-topics-truncated tbl-colwidths="[10, 10, 10, 70]"}

The "Representation" column provides the keywords for each topic. We can see that the keywords retrieved for the noise cluster are very generic: "study", "thesis", "model", "analysis", "approach" and do not convey any meaningful information other than the fact that all documents are academic documents.
<br/>

For each topic the model identifies apparently consistent keywords : 

- 'mechanical', 'numerical', 'model', 'finite', 'element': this cluster may be grouping theses related to numerical simulation in mechanics using the finite element method.
- ‘cells’, ‘cancer’, ‘tumor’, ‘immune’, ‘patients’: this cluster may be grouping theses related to cancer and cures.
- ‘building’, ‘ventilation’, ‘heat’, ‘cooling’: this cluster may be grouping theses related to the thermodynamics of buildings.

This is not a proof that our model generated interesting results, for that we need to carry further investigation of each cluster, still this is a first step towards appreciating the quality of the topic model.

In this table we can see that almost half of the documents are classified as noise (topic -1). This is a normal behaviour of the clustering algorithm as it focuses on dense areas first. This way, the topic model creates representations that focus fewer documents to retrieve very specific keywords. The other 104 topics contain between 10 and 200 documents each, which correspond to 0.1% to 3% of the corpus. 

It is worth noting that the more documents in a cluster, the lower the topic index is. 

It is possible to re-assign clusters to documents clustered as noise with the `reduce_outliers` method, based on the documentation and the code, we recommend using the *"embedding"* strategy[^22]: 

```python
topics_reduced = topic_model.reduce_outliers(
    documents = docs, 
    topics = topics, 
    probabilities = probabilities, 
    embeddings = embeddings,
    strategy="embeddings" 
)
```

:::{.callout-warning}

The topic model is not altered and keywords are not re-generated.

## How to visualise your results{#sec-visualise-your-results}

Visualising your topics is central in topic modelling as this is most convenient way to explore your documents and your topic model. We are going to cover some of the most basic and helpful visualisations.

### 2D plot

The first thing we want to visualise is the space of the embeddings reduced to 2 dimensions. This is a good start to visualise the size of your clusters and if close clusters have similar topics.

```python
(
	topic_model
	.visualize_documents(
		docs = docs,
		embeddings = embeddings,
		hide_annotations = True, # better readability
		topics = [0,1,2,3]       # Select topics to highlight
		# height = 300, # Adjust the height of the plot
		# width = 800 # Adjust the width of the plot 
	)
)
```

![2D plot of the french theses for a basic topic model[^18]](./assets/tuto_2d_plot.png){#fig-2d-plot}

On this graph only displaying the 4 top topics, we can see that the cluster are large and dense. We can see that the "1_mechanical_numerical_behavior" and the "3_flow_numerical_fluid" are close, as expected whereas "0_literary_writing_art" and "2_cells_cancer_tumor" are further apart in separate directions.

### Visualise top words per topic

The second helpful visualisation is to illustrate the top $n$ words that represent each topic and how representative they are of a given topic. It is a good way to analyse the consistency of each topic and get a sense of the documents inside a cluster.

```python 
topic_model.visualize_barchart(
	n_words = 10, # Select the number of words to display per topic
	# topics = [0,1,2,3,4], # Select specific topics to display
	# top_n_topics = 6, # Select the first n topics to display
	# height = 300, # Adjust the height of the plot
	# width = 800 # Adjust the width of the plot 
)
```

![Top $n$ words per topic of the french theses for a basic topic model](./assets/tuto_top_n_words.png){#fig-top-n-words}

Take the topic n°5, we can see keywords like "urban", "land", "city", "local", "public" and "ecological". These keywords make sense together and we can imagine theses discussing urban planning at different scales and under different constraints.

### Hierarchical trees

A good way to visualise how topics interact with each other is to plot a dendogram. This plot is read from left to right, the sooner branches merge, the closer related topics are. We use the `visualize_hierarchy` method. The graph is very tall but we can easily focus on one subset of the tree at a time.

```python
fig = topic_model.visualize_hierarchy()
```

![Hierarchical graph of the french theses for a basic topic model](./assets/tuto_hierarchical.png){#fig-hierarchical-plot}

At the very top of this graph, we can see the green branches related to laws and international rights, very close to contract legislation. This is a good sign that these three branches merge together and that we dont find legislation-related keywords anywhere else in the three.

### Additional visualisations

If you have additional tags for your dataset, such as categories or dates, you can easily display your topic analysis in regard of these dimensions.

In our case, we have OAI codes that account for the field each thesis is in. Hence we can compare the generated topics with the fields.

```python
# some theses are in multiple fields, 
# the oai code is: 
# ddc:XXX||ddc:YYY
# for simplicity, we are going to keep the first field for each thesis
first_oai = [oai_code[:7] for oai_code in ds["oai_set_specs"]]

# Let's translate that to human language:
oai_names = {
    "ddc:300" : "Sciences sociales, sociologie, anthropologie",
    "ddc:340" : "Droit",
    "ddc:004" : "Informatique",
    "ddc:570" : "Sciences de la vie, biologie, biochimie",
    "ddc:540" : "Chimie, minéralogie, cristallographie",
    "ddc:620" : "Sciences de l'ingénieur",
    "ddc:550" : "Sciences de la terre",
    "ddc:530" : "Physique",
    "ddc:510" : "Mathématiques",
    "ddc:610" : "Médecine et santé"
}
def retrieve_name(oai_code):
    if oai_code in oai_names:
        return oai_names[oai_code]
    else : 
		return "Autre"

first_oai_names = [retrieve_name(oai_code) for oai_code in first_oai]

topics_per_class = topic_model.topics_per_class(docs, classes=first_oai_names)
topic_model.visualize_topics_per_class(
    topics_per_class,
    topics = [0, 1, 2, 3], # choose specifically which topics to display
    # top_n_topics = 10,   # choose to display the 10 largest topics
)
``` 

![Topics distributed over the OAI tags of the french theses for a basic topic model](./assets/tuto_topics_per_class.png){#fig-topic-per-class}

In this figure, we can start by checking that documents are associated to the right topic. For instance, it is coherent to see that documents of the topic '1_mechanical_numerical_behavior' are found in theses in Physics, Engineering Sciences; and that theses of the topic '2_cells_cancer_tumor' are found in theses in Health and Medicine as well as in Biology and Biochemistry.

If you want to visualise your topics on a temporal axis, you can use the the `visualize_topics_over_time` method.

```python
year = [int(float(year_as_string)) for year_as_string in ds["year"]]
topics_over_time = topic_model.topics_over_time(docs = docs, timestamps=year)
topic_model.visualize_topics_over_time(topics_over_time, topics = [0,1,2,3])
```

![Number of theses over the years in each group of the french theses for a basic topic model](./assets/tuto_temporal_axis.png){#fig-temporal-axis}

## Aggregate topics{#sec-aggregate-topics}

To aggregate topics, the algorithm proposed is to use the topic embedding (the mean of the document's embedding inside a cluster), compute the cosine similarity[^26] matrix and use the agglomerative clustering algorithm described [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html) to aggregate the topics. Once performed, all the documents are moved into a new group and keywords are re-generated.

With more than 100 topics, it is difficult to have a general idea of the main groups in the corpus. Looking back to the @fig-hierarchical-plot[^24] we can identify seven large branches we could reduce our topic model to.

```python
topic_model.reduce_topics(docs = docs, nr_topics=7 + 1) #Add one to account for the noise
#Retrieve the updated topics and probabilities
topics_reduced, probabilities_reduced = topic_model.topics_, topic_model.probabilities_
```

Then check the new representations like in the section @sec-create-instance.

```python
topic_info_reduced = topic_model.get_topic_info()
topic_info_reduced
```

: Topic information after aggregating topics {#tbl-topics-reduced tbl-colwidths="[10, 30, 60]"}

Similarly to before, the noise topic contains very generic keywords. As for the rest, we can identify seven[^10] main latent topics :

- Social Sciences
- Medicine and Health
- Engineering Sciences, Experimentation and Simulation
- Data analysis and Mathematics
- Physics 
- Law, Finance and Policies
- Biochemisty and sensors
 
The topics are very general and give us key insights about our corpus. 

A detailed analysis can be useful to understand the structure of the corpus. For instance, the keywords for the second main topic are too general, but because we analysed our documents in details, we know that this topic is the result of merging "1_mechanical_numerical_behavior" and "3_flow_numerical_fluid", allowing us to name this topic "Engineering Sciences, Experimentation and Simulation".

After reducing outliers, here is the distribution of topics across all out documents : 

|                                                      |   Topic |   Count | Proportion   |
|:-----------------------------------------------------|--------:|--------:|:-------------|
| Social Sciences                                      |       0 |    1749 | 27 %         |
| Medicine and Health                                  |       1 |    1328 | 20 %         |
| Engineering Sciences, Experimentation and Simulation |       2 |    1106 | 17 %         |
| Data analysis and Mathematics                        |       3 |    1073 | 17 %         |
| Physics                                              |       4 |     803 | 12 %         |
| Law, Finance and Policies                            |       5 |     410 | 6 %          |
| Biochemisty and sensors                              |       6 |      31 | 0 %          |

: Repartition of the theses in the 7 aggregated topics {#tbl-topics-reduced-stats tbl-colwidths="[50, 10, 20, 20]"}

Finally, the 7th topic still seem very specific, even after reducing outliers, there are only 31 documents in this topic.

## Tune parameters{#sec-tune-parameters}

A diversity of parameters can be used to tune the topic model. In this section, we propose to tune the 3 most useful parameters outlined in the litterature : the embedding model, `n_neighbors` (UMAP) and `n_components` (HDBSCAN). A table can be found in the [techy notes](./techy-notes.qmd#umap-and-hdbscan-parameter-despcription) providing descriptions for other parameters.

**1. Assess the quality of the text representations** (parameters tuned: embedding model)

The primary factor to tune is the embedding model, because it drastically impact the results of the topic model. To check if the embedding makes sense, you can plot the 2D map after dimension reduction with UMAP (`n_components=2`). Then, by exploring the map, you can assess if the embedding space created placed similar documents together or not.

At this point you can also try different values for `n_neighbors` and `n_components`. However, be aware that the influence of UMAP parameters on the final topic model is difficult to appreciate at first glance.

**Tune the granularity of the topic model** (parameters tuned: `n_neighbors` and `min_cluster_size`)

Once you've chosen an embedding model, you can change the `n_neighbors` and `min_cluster_size`. Both work jointly: the lower these paramters, the smaller grain and more specific the topics. 

To change these parameters, one must explicitly declare `UMAP` and `HDBSCAN` objects and pass them on to the `BERTopic` model:

```python
# Load data and create the vectorizer model like before
language = "english" # or "french"
language_short = language[:2] # "en" or "fr"
ds = load_from_disk(f"./data/embeddings/gte-multilingual-base-{language_short}-SBERT")
docs = np.array(ds[f"resumes.{language_short}"]) # 6500 rows
embeddings = np.array(ds["embedding"])			 # Shape : 6500 x 768
vectorizer_model = CountVectorizer(stop_words = list(stopwords(language_short)))

# create an HDBSCAN and UMAP models
hdbscan_model = HDBSCAN(
    min_cluster_size=50, 
	# Default parameters 
    prediction_data=True
)
umap_model = UMAP(
    n_neighbors = 50,
	# Default parameters
    metric = "cosine",
    n_components = 5,
    min_dist=0.0,
    low_memory = False 
)

# Then create the instance, fit the model and extract the topics and probabilities
topic_model = BERTopic(
	language = language,
	vectorizer_model = vectorizer_model,
    umap_model= umap_model,
    hdbscan_model=hdbscan_model
)
topics, probabilities = topic_model.fit_transform(
    documents=docs, 
    embeddings=embeddings
)
```

We obtain the following results: 

|   Topic |   Count | Representation                                                                                                       |

## Discussion on evaluating a topic model

Topic model evaluation is an active domain of research that goes beyond the scope of this tutorial. We propose an overview of the methods that exist and how to quickly tell if your topic model can be used or needs to be refined.

In short: quantitative methods are impractical and one should focus more on the qualitative evaluation.

### Qualitative evaluation

All along the tutorial, we have displayed many results and analysed them with the objective to answer the very question: is the topic model coherent? There is no one way around qualitatively evaluating your BERTopic, however the point is to offer some techniques we found useful and code snippets to quickly obtain key insights on your topic model performance.

**Extensively use the visualisation tools**

As presented in @sec-visualise-your-results, there are many tools to visualise the results of your topic model that can help you assess the coherence of the topics through 2D representation, top n words, hierarchical and the tag distribution. 

**Explore the merging process**

When merging topics at @sec-aggregate-topics we may want to monitor what's going where. The following snippet prints out the topics that were merged into them: 

```python 
for iRow_reduced, topic_id in enumerate(topic_info_reduced["Topic"]):
    print(topic_info_reduced.loc[iRow_reduced, "Name"].replace("_", " "))
    og_topics_merged_to_new_topic = list(set([
        int(og_topic) 
        for og_topic, new_topic in zip(topics, topics_reduced) 
        if new_topic == topic_id
    ]))
    for og_topic in og_topics_merged_to_new_topic:
        print(
            "\t - ",
            topic_info.loc[
                topic_info["Topic"] == og_topic,
                "Name"
            ]
            .item()
            .replace("_", " ")
        ) 
    print("---")
```

```bash 
>>> ...
>>> 5 law legal international rights
>>>	 -  66 monetary policy inflation exchange
>>>	 -  70 contract law contractual subsidy
>>>	 -  46 constitutional judge legal council
>>>	 -  22 international law european rights
>>>	 -  89 financial law tax transactions
>>>	 -  58 financial economic banks growth
>>> ...
```

In this example we can confidently assess that the merge is coherent as it groups all law related topics into one.

**Explore the reason why a given document was clustered in a specific group**

The `topics_per_class` is a powerful method that retrieve top keywords found in specific documents that justify assigning it to a given cluster: 

```python 
# Select a document
text_id = 3000
is_my_document = [i == text_id for i in range(len(docs))]
print(f"Doc n°{text_id}:\n{docs[text_id]}")

topics_per_class = topic_model.topics_per_class(docs, classes = is_my_document)
topics_per_class = topics_per_class.loc[topics_per_class["Class"], :].set_index("Topic")
# Retrieve the Topic Representation for comparison
topics_name = (topic_model.get_topic_info().set_index("Topic")["Name"])
topics_per_class.loc[:,"Topic Name"] = topics_name
print(topics_per_class.reset_index().to_markdown())
```

```bash 
>>> Doc n°3000:
>>> The overall objective of this thesis is to exploit a ...
```

| Topic | Words | Frequency | Class | Topic Name |
|---:|:---|---:|:---|:---|
|       3 | social, annotations, multimedia, snapshot, proposed |           1 | True    | 3_data_thesis_systems_model |

: {tbl-colwidths="[10, 30, 10, 20, 30]"}

If you have additional tags, it's even more powerful as you can check the keywords for a whole class:

```python 
OAI_REFS = pd.read_csv("./data/oai_codes.csv")
DS = ds
def get_docs_for_oai_code(oai_code : str):
    try: 
        oai_name = OAI_REFS.loc[OAI_REFS["code"] == oai_code, "name"].item()
    except Exception:
        print(f"oai code {oai_code} invalid\n\nException:\n{Exception}")
        return
    
    def return_name(codes):
        if oai_code in codes: 
            return oai_name
        else: 
            return "Autre"

    classes = [return_name(codes) for codes in ds["oai_set_specs"]]
    topics_per_class = topic_model.topics_per_class(docs, classes = classes)
    topics_per_class = topics_per_class.loc[topics_per_class["Class"] == oai_name, :].set_index("Topic")
    topics_name = (
        topic_model
        .get_topic_info()
        .set_index("Topic")
        ["Name"]
    )
    topics_per_class.loc[:,"Topic Name"] = topics_name
    return topics_per_class.loc[topics_per_class["Class"] == oai_name, :].reset_index()

get_docs_for_oai_code("ddc:300")
```

|   Topic | Words | Frequency | Class | Topic Name |
|---:|:---|---:|:---|:---|

### Quantitative evaluation

In this section we introduce different metrics that can be used to evaluate your topic model. However, we mainly included it to warn you of the complexity behind evaluating a topic model and that there is no one-fit-all solution. 

> First, choosing the coherence score by itself can have a large influence on the difference in performance you will find between models. For example, NPMI and UCI may each lead to quite different values. Second, the coherence score only tells a part of the story. Perhaps your purpose is more classification than having the most coherent words or perhaps you want as diverse topics as possible. These use cases require vastly different evaluation metrics to be used.
>
> Response to "How to evaluate the performance of the model?" by Maarten Grootendorst [source](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/issues/437)

There are two types of metrics that you could use:

- Cluster metrics — ie focus on the group making. There exist a lot of metrics, but few are fit to our situation: unsupervised learning with density based algorithms. In our experience, optimising these metrics result in a sub-optimal solutions as illustrated bellow. [Read more](./techy-notes.qmd#clustering-metrics)
- Topic representation metrics — ie focus on how relevant the keywords are. Although some metrics exist their utility is limited: good score does not necessarily align with what expert consider good topic models, and they are not good scores to optimise (Stammbach et al., 2023). [Read more](./techy-notes.qmd#coherence-metrics)


# Some good practices

Now that you have a good understanding of BERTopic, and you started to experiment with it, you may want more practical advices. Here, we list some tips to reduce computation time and facilitate reproducibility.

## Save your instance locally

For reproducibility purposes, and more generally, it is important to save your work, BERTopic lets you do that with the `save`[^25] method. Two parameters of importance:

- `serialization (str)`: must be `"safetensors"`, `"pickle"` or `"pytorch"`. We recommend to use `"safetensors"` or the `"pytorch"` format as they are broadly used in machine learning and recommended by the [BERTopic documentation](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/api/bertopic.html#bertopic._bertopic.BERTopic.save)[^6].
- `save_ctfidf (bool)` : wether to save the vectorizer configuration or not. This is the heaviest bit (see table below).

```python
# ~ 500 KB
topic_model.save(
	path = "./bertopic-default",
	serialization = "safetensors",
	save_ctfidf = False
)

# ~ 6MB
topic_model.save(
	path = "./bertopic-default-with-ctfidf",
	serialization = "safetensors",
	save_ctfidf = True
)
```

The to reload your instance you just need to use the `load` method:

```python
topic_model = BERTopic.load("./bertopic-default")
```

Saving the instance is a good practice, as we will see below, when reducing the number of topics, the instance is updated and you can't go back. Hence, we would recommend to save at least one instance — _or rerun the whole cell_.

## Precompute your embeddings

Pre-computing the embeddings is a good practice as it will prevent from computing them at each run, but also because it allows you to use a broader spectrum of embedding models. This comes handy when you want to test different parameters of clustering and cluster representation. Moreover, saving BERTopics models does not save the embeddings, so it is good practice to manage them separately.

To embed our documents, we use the [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) objects to manage the data and the [sentence-bert](https://www.sbert.net) (**SBERT**) library to embed the documents. The process is very straightforward, you need to open your file and preprocess your texts. Then after loading the model 

```python
from datasets import Dataset
from gc import collect as gc_collect
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from torch.cuda import is_available as cuda_available
from torch.cuda import synchronize, ipc_collect, empty_cache

ds = Dataset.load_from_disk("...")
# implement your preprocess and open functions
texts : list[str] = preprocess(ds["texts"]) 
# Use GPU if you have one
device = "cuda" if cuda_available() else "cpu" 

sbert_model = SentenceTransformer(
    model_name, 
    device = device, 
    trust_remote_code = True
)

sbert_model.max_seq_length = min(
    sbert_model.max_seq_length,
    np.inf # Replace with desired window size
)

try : 
    embeddings = (
        sbert_model
        .encode(
            texts, 
            device=str(device), 
            normalize_embeddings=True, 
            show_progress_bar=True
        )
    )
    ds = ds.add_column("embedding", list(embeddings))
    ds.save_to_disk("embeddings")
except Exception:
    print(Exception)
finally:
    # Make sure to clean your GPU
    del sbert_model, ds
    empty_cache()
    if cuda_available():
        synchronize()
        ipc_collect()
    gc_collect()

```

We retrieve the embeddings and the documents

```python
ds = load_from_disk("path/to/file")
docs = np.array(ds[f"texts"]) # Number of documents : 6500
embeddings = np.array(ds["embedding"]) # shape : (6500, 768)
```

## Force deterministic behaviour 

The BERTopic pipeline is deterministic apart from the UMAP component. To force a deterministic behaviour: 

```python 
topic_model = BERTopic(
    ...
    umap_model= UMAP(
        ...
        random_state=RANDOM_SEED
    )
)
```

You can also set the random state for Numpy (used by Pandas) with `np.random.seed(RANDOM_SEED)`.

# Conclusion

In this tutorial we have explained how to use BERTopic a Python library that facilitates the exploration of a corpus of text. The pipeline leverages several NLP tools such as encoder models and clustering techniques to generate groups of similar texts, as well as bag-of-words techniques to retrieve insightful keywords. We have demonstrated how to create a topic model, tune it and visualise the results. We have also provided ready-to-use techniques to qualitatively evaluate your topic model. 

The most important steps to follow to obtain a coherent topic model are : 

- Define what you want out of your topic model and preprocess your texts accordingly.
- Carefully choose your topic model and assess the quality of the embedding space.
- Tune your parameters in order to get a topic model with the desired granularity.
- Visualise your results and assess the quality of your topics and the coherence of the documents within a given topic.

[^1]:The UMAP algorithm is very close to the t-SNE algorithm with better scaling capabilities. Another good option for the dimensionality reduction step is the PCA algorithm that will focus on the global structure. PCA is a better choice if you solely focus on the big picture (McInnes et al., 2018, p45).

[^5]: To be accurate, we count for n-grams: n-grams are sequences of textual entities (tokens or words). In the context of topic modelling, 1-grams would be words, 2-grams would be sequences of 2 words and so on.

[^6]: Disclaimer: You may want to highlight these dimensions to identify hate speech, for instance. Homogeneity has to be relevant to your use case and questioning your corpus is a part of the topic modelling pipeline that should not remain overlooked.

[^7]: As a rule of thumb, 1 token = 3 characters

[^10]: We have seven topics because we asked the topic model to reduce the number of topics to seven.

[^14]: the name "transformer models" refers to a specific neural netword designed popularised by Vaswani et al. (2017), most if not all current Language models rely on this architecture.

[^16]: Previously, the transformer model worked at the token level.

[^18]: The space represented is not necessarily the space used during the clustering step. `UMAP(n_dimensions = 2)` is run on the embeddings when plotting. Also, because UMAP is non-deterministic, the result may differ from a run to another. This explains why some dots seem far away from their cluster.

[^19]: "Pre-Trained" means that the model has already been trained on millions of documents. "Transformer" is the name of a neural network architecture broadly used in machine learning.

[^24]: There is a small difference in the computation of the graph and the reduce outlier that we do not clearly understand. [See Discussion #2453](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/discussions/2453).
